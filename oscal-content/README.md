# OSCAL Content

Directory containing example OSCAL files.

## Purpose
The oscal-content directory exists to provide example OSCAL files to
be used as content for the REST service. It provides the expected
directory structure for the files, with one directory each for
Catalogs, Components, Profiles, and System Security Plans.

The files in this directory are also used to test and validate different
aspects of the REST service.

## Source
The OSCAL files are all pulled from the [Oscal Content](https://github.com/EasyDynamics/oscal-content)
repository.
